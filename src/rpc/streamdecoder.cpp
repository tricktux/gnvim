 * This function uses `mpack_tree_try_parse` which in turn calls `read_iodev`, 
 * which in turn calls `iodevice->recv`, which then asynchronously retrieves 
 * data in `output` string.
 * `mpack_tree_root` converts the `mpack_tree_t` into a `mpack_node_t`
 * See @ref ReprocDevice::recv
 * @return `mpack_node_t`
